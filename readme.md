# Project Overview

## Data Collection
We gathered data by distributing a survey through Google Forms. The survey was targeted at French computer science students. You can view the survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2KaGxYLs_nTfyjpxvq2a0NsvQ70HKW2MxasG07UgxX1uyZw/viewform).

## Data Analysis
In the `main.py` script, we performed the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the survey responses into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Visualization**: Created various plots to visualize the distribution of responses.

This analysis helped us understand the demographics and opinions of French computer science students regarding AI in their education.
