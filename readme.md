# Project Overview

## Data Collection
We gathered data by distributing a survey through Google Forms. The survey was targeted at French computer science students. You can view the survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2KaGxYLs_nTfyjpxvq2a0NsvQ70HKW2MxasG07UgxX1uyZw/viewform).

## Data Analysis
In the `main.py` script, we performed the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the survey responses into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Visualization**: Created various plots to visualize the distribution of responses.

This analysis helped us understand the demographics and opinions of French computer science students regarding AI in their education.

## K-Means Clustering
In the `kmeans_clustering.py` script, we performed the following tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized the survey data to prepare it for clustering.
2. **Model Training**: Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar responses.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to identify common patterns and insights.

This clustering helped us segment the students into distinct groups based on their responses, providing deeper insights into their perspectives on AI in education.
